# Sprinter/Make Me Write

A tool for timed writing sprints similar to [Write Or Die](https://writeordie.com). The user sets a time and word count goal, and the app provides feedback when the user isn't typing fast enough.

## Try Demo

I maintain a demo of the latest working version of the app [here](https://make-me-write.web.app).

## Feedback

This app is in early development, and I welcome feature suggestions and bug reports. Send any feedback to [kelliedlynch@gmail.com](mailto:kelliedlynch@gmail.com).
